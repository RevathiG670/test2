What is Python?
Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.

It is used for:

web development (server-side),
software development,
mathematics,
system scripting.

Python Comments:
Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

Variables:
Variables are containers for storing data values.

#Creating Variables:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)

Casting:
Example
x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
y = int(3)    # y will be 3
z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0

Variable Names:
It start with a letter or the underscore character
it cannot start with a number
it only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)

Example:
myvar = "John"
my_var = "John"
_my_var = "John"
myVar = "John"
MYVAR = "John"
myvar2 = "John"

Multi Words Variable Names:
camel case
pascal case
snake case

#Output Variables:
print() function is used to output variables.
Example:
x = "Python is awesome"
print(x)

#Global variables:
def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)

Built-in Data Types:
Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
Mapping Type:	dict
Set Types:	set
Boolean Type:	bool
Binary Types:	bytes
None Type:	NoneType

Python Numbers:
There are three numeric types in Python:

1.int:
x = 1
y = 35656222554887711
z = -3255522
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

2.float:
x = 1.10
y = 1.0
z = -35.59
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

3.complex:
x = 3+5j
y = 5j
z = -5j
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

python strings:

# slicing string
x="todays homework"
print(x[4:5])

# slice from start
x="todays homework"
print(x[:5])

# slice to the end
x="todays homework"
print(x[5:])

# negative indexing
x="todays homework"
print(x[-4:-5])


#modify string
#uppercase
x="todays homework"
print(x.upper())

#lowercase
x="todays homework"
print(x.lower())

#remove whitespace
x=" todays homework "
print(x.strip())

#replace string
x="rates homework"
print(x.replace("r","h"))

#split string
x="todays, homework"
print(x.split(","))

#concatenation string
x="i"
y=" hate"
z=" homework"
a=x+y+z
print(a)

#string format
#f-string
string=1
txt=f"i have {string} cat"
print(txt)

#placeholders and modifiers
string=2000
txt=f"my cat is {string:.2f} rupees"
print(txt)

#escape characters
txt="i hate doing \"homeworks\"."
print(txt)
